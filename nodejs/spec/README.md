Node.js Test Suite for Volar Video
=====================
The Node.js test suite uses the jasmine-node testing framework. To install jasmine-node run:
```
npm install -g jasmine-node
```

The tests can then be executed from the command line by doing:
```
jasmine-node spec
```
This will run the full test suite.  To run individual test files, like Sites, for example, run:
```
jasmine-node spec/Site_Spec.js
```
